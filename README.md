# Install Cypress and run the automated test
Although the project already contains the necessary dependencies to be downloaded and executed (clone project), here is a brief guide on how to install Cypress and run the project.

1. The tool chosen to automate the test on this occasion is Cypress in its latest version
   
2. Configure the test environment
-Requirement: have npm installed, npm install latest-version. Have Visual Studio code installed (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
-Create a folder in any desired location
-Open the folder created in the previous step and install cypress from the command line, npm install cypress â€“save-dev
-Then run the npx cypress open command
-In the new window select the option E2E Testing>Continue
-Select the Browser of your preference>Start E2E Testing in Chrome
-Select the option Create new spec > Create spec > Ok run the spec
-Close the test runner windows and return to Visual Studio code, notice that a new folder was created with the name Cypress
-Open the cypress>e2e folder
- Copy the content from the repo (e2e, pages, etc) in the new cypress installation

 3. Run the automated test
-Run the test again with the npx cypress open command
-Select E2E Testing>Chrome>Start E2E Testing in Chrome

# Generate reports in Cypress
Although the project already contains the necessary dependencies to generate reports, here is a brief guide on how to install Mocha Reporter and generate some reports of the execution, the project already contains some examples of previously executed reports in HTML format within the cypress/reports folder.

1. Reports in Cypress can be generated using Mocha reporter
2. Install the library and configure it in Cypress
-In the command line install
 npm install mochawesome --save-dev
 npm install mochawesome-merge --save-dev
 npm install mochawesome-report-generator --save-dev

-Configure the cypress config.js file, include the following within defineConfig
reporter: 'mochawesome',
  "reporterOptions": {
    "reportDir": "cypress/reports",
    "overwrite": false,
    "html": true,
    "json": false
  },


-Configure the Package.json file and include the following Script
"scripts": {
    "runner": "cypress open",
    "html-report": "npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/homePageValidations.cy.js --browser chrome --headed"
  }

-To run the test and execute the report it is necessary to execute the previous script in the command line, this will execute the test directly in visual mode, and after execution the cypress>reports folder will be generated, and inside the HTML file with the details of the test execution (with the detail if any of the tests passed or failed)
